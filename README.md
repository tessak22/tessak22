## 💡 Philosophy

I believe founders and product teams often miss critical insights because they're not hearing from developers with radical honesty. **built-for-devs** exists to fix that. By connecting product teams with real developers who'll give them candid feedback, we help companies build products that actually solve developer problems.

At its core, it's about respect: respecting developers' time and expertise, and respecting founders' need for truth. The best products come from understanding both sides deeply.
